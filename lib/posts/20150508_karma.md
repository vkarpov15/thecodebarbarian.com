I have often quipped that if I were stuck on a desert island with
only one npm module, I'd choose
[karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma).
The one place where you can't avoid using JavaScript is in the
browser. Even
[Dart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29)
needs to be transpiled to JavaScript to work on browsers other than
[Dartium](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/). And code that
can't be tested should not be written. Karma is a widely-adopted
command-line tool for testing JavaScript code in real browsers.
It has [myriad plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=karma) that
enable you to write tests using virtually any framework (mocha, 
jasmine, ngScenario, etc.) and run them against a local browser
or in [Sauce's Selenium cloud](https://saucelabs.com/).

In this article, you'll see how to use karma to test standalone
JavaScript locally, to test DOM interactions locally, and to run
tests on Sauce Labs. The code for all these examples is available
on
[my karma-demo GitHub repo](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo).

Your First Karma Test
---------------------

Like [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) or
[metalsmith](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith), karma is
organized as a lightweight core surrounded by a loose confederation
of plugins. Although you will interact with the karma core
executable, you will typically need to install numerous plugins to
do anything useful.

Suppose you have a trivial browser-side JavaScript file like below.
This code is
[`lib/sample.js` in the karma-demo GitHub repo](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/master/lib/sample.js)

```javascript
function theAnswer() {
  return 42;
}
```

Testing this in NodeJS would be fairly simple. But, what if you
wanted to test this in a real browser, like Chrome?
Let's say you have the
[following test file](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/master/test/sample.test.js).

```javascript
describe('sample', function() {
  it('returns 42', function() {
    assert.equal(theAnswer(), 42);
  });
});
```

To run this test in Chrome, set up your `package.json` with
karma and 3 plugins. As you might expect, `karma-mocha` is
a karma plugin that enables you to use the
[mocha test framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), and
`karma-chrome-launcher` enables karma to launch Chrome locally.
The `karma-chai` package is a wrapper around the
[`chai` assertion framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai),
since neither mocha nor karma includes an assertion framework by
default.

```javascript
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "karma": "0.12.31",
    "karma-chai": "0.1.0",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "0.1.4",
    "karma-mocha": "0.1.10"
  }
}
```

Now that you have karma installed, you need a karma config file.
You can run `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma init` to have karma
initialize one for you, but the
[karma config file you're going to need](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/master/test/karma.mocha.conf.js)
is shown below.

```javascript
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    // Use cwd as base path
    basePath: '',

    // Include mocha test framework and chai assertions
    frameworks: ['mocha', 'chai'],

    // Include the test and source files
    files: ['../lib/*.js', './sample.test.js'],

    // Use built-in 'progress' reporter
    reporters: ['progress'],

    // Boilerplate
    urlRoot : '/__karma__/',
    port: 8080,
    runnerPort: 9100,
    colors: true,
    logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,

    /* Karma can watch the file system for changes and
     * automatically re-run tests. Making karma do it
     * is more efficient than using gulp because karma
     * can re-use the same browser process. Set this to
     * true and `singleRun` to false to run tests
     * continuously */
    autoWatch: false,

    // Set the browser to run
    browsers: ['Chrome'],

    // See autoWatch
    singleRun: true,

    // Consider browser as dead if no response for 5 sec
    browserNoActivityTimeout: 5000
  });
};
```

One key feature of the above config file is that karma configs are
NodeJS JavaScript, not just JSON or YAML. You can do file I/O,
access environment variables, and `require()` npm modules in your
karma configs.

Once you have this config file, you can run karma using the
`./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/karma.mocha.conf.js` 
command. You should see a Chrome browser pop up and output similar 
to what you see below in the shell:

```
$ ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start ./test/karma.mocha.conf.js 
WARN [karma]: Port 8080 in use
INFO [karma]: Karma v0.12.31 server started at http://localhost:8081/__karma__/

```

Testing DOM Interactions with ngScenario
----------------------------------------

Karma isn't just useful for testing isolated JavaScript. With
[ngScenario](https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.16/docs/guide/e2e-testing)
and the
[karma-ng-scenario plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-ng-scenario)
you can test DOM interactions against your local server in a
real browser. In this particular example, you will test
interactions with a trivial page. However, ngScenario, as the
name implies, was developed by the AngularJS team to test
AngularJS applications, so you can use karma to test single
page apps too.

Suppose you want to test
[the following page](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/master/lib/sample.html),
which uses the `sample.js` file from the previous section to
display the number "42" on the page.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/sample.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function onLoad() {
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = theAnswer();
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="onLoad()">
    <div id="content"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In order to serve this page and the `sample.js` file, you need
an HTTP server. You can put together a simple one using
[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
as show below.

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.use(express.static('./lib'));

app.listen(3000);
console.log('Server listening on 3000');
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sample.html` and you should
see the number "42". Now, let's set up karma to test this.

In order to use ngScenario with karma, you need to install the
karma-ng-scenario plugin.

```javascript
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.12.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "karma": "0.12.31",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "0.1.4",
    "karma-ng-scenario": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Once you have the karma-ng-scenario plugin, you will need to
create a [slightly modified karma config file](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/f0094a17f7fbf5b6a3941bd6066030dfbd63ab89/test/karma.ng-scenario.conf.js).
The `git diff` between this file and the previous section's config file `karma.mocha.conf.js` is shown below.

```javascript
 module.exports = function(config) {
   config.set({
     basePath: '',
 
-    frameworks: ['mocha', 'chai'],
+    frameworks: ['ng-scenario'],
 
-    files: ['../lib/*.js', './sample.test.js'],
+    files: ['./scenario.test.js'],
 
     reporters: ['progress'],
 
     urlRoot : '/__karma__/',
 
+    proxies : {
+      '/': 'http://localhost:3000'
+    },
+
     port: 8080,
     runnerPort: 9100,
     colors: true,
 
     logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,
 
-    autoWatch: false,
+    autoWatch: true,
 
     browsers: ['Chrome'],
 
-    singleRun: true,
+    singleRun: false,
 
-    // 5 sec
-    browserNoActivityTimeout: 5000
+    // 45 sec
+    browserNoActivityTimeout: 45000
   });
 };
```

That's all you need! Now, start your web server with
`node index.js` (your web server needs to be running for
ngScenario to work) and run `karma start` to execute your tests.

```
$ ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/karma.ng-scenario.conf.js 
WARN [proxy]: proxy "http://localhost:3000" normalized to "http://localhost:3000/"
WARN [karma]: Port 8080 in use
INFO [karma]: Karma v0.12.31 server started at http://localhost:8081/__karma__/
INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
INFO [Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3)]: Connected on socket pyFsC9jnnhcbkTXT5y3t with id 7382597
Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0 secs / 0.137 secChrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.152 secs / 0.137 secs)
```

The `karma.ng-scenario.conf.js` file is configured for karma to
automatically re-run tests if any of the loaded files change.
Suppose you changed the test file `scenario.test.js` to break:

```javascript
describe('sample.html', function() {
  it('displays 42', function() {
    browser().navigateTo('/sample.html');
    // This assertion will fail
    expect(element('#content').text()).toBe('43');
  });
});
```

Karma will automatically re-run tests and show you the following
output.

```
INFO [watcher]: Changed file "/Users/vkarpov/Workspace/karma-demo/test/scenario.test.js".
Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3) sample.html displays 42 FAILED
  expect element '#content' text toBe "43"
  /Users/vkarpov/Workspace/karma-demo/test/scenario.test.js:4:32: expected "43" but was "42"
Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3): Executed 1 of 1 (1 FAILED) (0 secs / 0.121 Chrome 42.0.2311 (Mac OS X 10.10.3): Executed 1 of 1 (1 FAILED) ERROR (0.136 secs / 0.121 secs)
```

**Note** the AngularJS team considers `ngScenario` to be
deprecated in favor of
[protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor). However,
I still think ngScenario and karma have a key niche to fill in
terms of testing JavaScript DOM interactions against a local 
server as part of TDD workflow. If you're interested in working with me to re-imagine how ngScenario should
work, shoot me an email at val [at] karpov [dot] io.

To the Cloud!
-------------

So far, you've only tested your code in Chrome. While testing
in Chrome is better than not testing in the browser at all,
it's far from a complete testing paradigm. Thankfully, there's
[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/), a cloud Selenium service that
you can think of as Amazon EC2 for browsers. You can tell Sauce
to start Internet Explorer 6 running on Windows XP and give you
full control over this browser for testing purposes. In order to
get the tests in this section to work, you will have to sign up
for an account with [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) to get
an API key.

To integrate karma with Sauce, you're going to need the
karma-sauce-launcher plugin.

```javascript
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.12.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "karma": "0.12.31",
    "karma-chai": "0.1.0",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "0.1.4",
    "karma-ng-scenario": "0.1.0",
    "karma-mocha": "0.1.10",
    "karma-sauce-launcher": "0.2.8"
  }
}
```

To run the ngScenario test from the previous section on IE9 and
Safari 5 using Sauce, create
[another karma config file](https://github.com/vkarpov15/karma-demo/blob/master/test/karma.sauce.conf.js).
The `git diff` between this new file and the previous section's config file is show below.

```javascript
module.exports = function(config) {
+  var customLaunchers = {
+    sl_safari: {
+      base: 'SauceLabs',
+      browserName: 'safari',
+      platform: 'OS X 10.6',
+      version: '5'
+    },
+    sl_ie_9: {
+      base: 'SauceLabs',
+      browserName: 'internet explorer',
+      platform: 'Windows 7',
+      version: '9'
+    }
+  };
+
   config.set({
     basePath: '',

     frameworks: ['ng-scenario'],

     files: ['./scenario.test.js'],

-    reporters: ['progress'],
+    reporters: ['saucelabs'],

     urlRoot : '/__karma__/',

     proxies : {
       '/': 'http://localhost:3000'
     },

     port: 8080,
     runnerPort: 9100,
     colors: true,

     logLevel: config.LOG_INFO,

-    autoWatch: true,
+    autoWatch: false,
+
+    // Use these custom launchers for starting browsers on Sauce
+    customLaunchers: customLaunchers,

-    browsers: ['Chrome'],
+    // start these browsers
+    // available browser launchers: https://npmjs.org/browse/keyword/karma-launcher
+    browsers: Object.keys(customLaunchers),

-    singleRun: false,
+    singleRun: true,

     // 45 sec
-    browserNoActivityTimeout: 45000
+    browserNoActivityTimeout: 45000,
+
+    sauceLabs: {
+      testName: 'Web App E2E Tests'
+    },
   });
 };
```

This is all you need to do. Karma handles setting up an SSH
tunnel for you, so the Sauce browser can make real requests to
your local server.

```
$ env SAUCE_USERNAME=<username here> env SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<API key here> ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start test/karma.sauce.conf.js 
WARN [proxy]: proxy "http://localhost:3000" normalized to "http://localhost:3000/"
WARN [karma]: Port 8080 in use
INFO [karma]: Karma v0.12.31 server started at http://localhost:8081/__karma__/
INFO [launcher]: Starting browser safari 5 (OS X 10.6) on SauceLabs
INFO [launcher]: Starting browser internet explorer 9 (Windows 7) on SauceLabs
INFO [launcher.sauce]: internet explorer 9 (Windows 7) session at https://saucelabs.com/tests/d6d4c7a5eebe493d9e98bc3559106e54

TOTAL: 2 SUCCESS
INFO [launcher.sauce]: Shutting down Sauce Connect
```

**Note** the above example does not use autowatch. This is because,
in my experience, end-to-end tests run on Sauce labs are too slow 
for the type of fast feedback I'd like from the 'test on save'
paradigm. These heavy end-to-end tests are
best run through a CI framework like
[Travis](http://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/02/13/travis_coveralls) 
or
[Shippable](http://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/04/10/shippable-an-alternative-take-on-travis).

Conclusion
----------

Karma is a powerful and extensible tool for testing client-side
JS, and very much deserves its spot on the
[npm home page](https://www.npmjs.com/). If there's one npm module
I can't write JS without, it's karma. Karma enables you to test
standalone JavaScript or DOM integrations, locally or in the
Sauce Labs cloud. With karma, you have no excuse for half-answers
like "I think so" when your boss asks you if the site works in IE8.

applications, as well as protractor.*
