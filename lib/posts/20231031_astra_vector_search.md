[Retrieval augmented generation](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag), or RAG for short, is a technique that injects additional relevant context into an LLM prompt in order to get better results.
For example, if you were to ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write a tweet about a new blog post describing how to work with [vector databases in Node.js](./getting-started-with-vector-databases-in-node-js.html), you might get the following output.

```
üöÄ Exciting News for Node.js Developers! üöÄ

This tweet is reasonable, but a bit generic.
How about if we add an example of [a relevant tweet](https://twitter.com/DataStax/status/1717654884139303026) and ask ChatGPT to copy the tone and style using the following prompt?

```
Write a tweet promoting a new blog post about working with vector databases in Node.js

Write using the style and tone of the following tweet:

The idea of RAG is to use a [vector database](./getting-started-with-vector-databases-in-node-js.html) to find relevant examples to the user's prompt, to help guide the LLM to a better result.
In this blog post, I'll show how to use [Astra's vector search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/overview.html) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to build a RAG chatbot that answers JavaScript programming questions using [Mastering JS' articles](https://masteringjs.io/) for context.

You can see the [full source code for the Mastering JS chatbot here](https://github.com/mastering-js/masteringjs-backend/blob/e760d30d32eb022ad47aafd7ffcc6ee16af9ae76/chatbot.js).
You can also access a [live version of the Mastering JS chatbot here](https://deploy-preview-335--masteringjs.netlify.app/tutorials/mocha/aftereach?show-chatbot=true), just be aware that this chatbot is limited to 100 queries per hour to prevent abuse.

Getting Started with Astra and Mongoose
--------------------------------

Astra's new vector search capabilities are integrated into Astra's JSON API, which means [you can use Mongoose queries to do vector search in Astra](./introducing-private-preview-for-stargate-mongoose-astra.html).
To get started, install Mongoose and [stargate-mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stargate-mongoose).

```
npm install mongoose stargate-mongoose
```

Next, deploy a new vector database on [Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3bkaFFt.png" style="width: 50%; border: 1px solid #ddd">

Click into your new Astra vector database, click "Connect", and find "Connect with the JSON API".
You should see the following instructions:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wN8GJkl.png" style="border: 1px solid #ddd">

Click "Generate Configuration" to get credentials for your Astra vector database.
You will get a `ASTRA_DB_ID`, `ASTRA_DB_REGION`, `ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE`, and `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`.
Copy these values into my [Astra connection string generation tool](./introducing-private-preview-for-stargate-mongoose-astra.html#connecting-mongoose-to-astra) to get your Astra connection string.
It should look like the following:

```
https://3418a8ac-OMITTED-us-east-2.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/json/v1/test?applicationToken=AstraCS:OMITTED
```

With an Astra connection string, you're now ready to connect to Astra and start querying documents.
Import Mongoose and stargate-mongoose as follows:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.set('autoCreate', false);
mongoose.set('autoIndex', false);

const { driver } = require('stargate-mongoose');
mongoose.setDriver(driver); // <-- Use stargate-mongoose driver
```

Then, connect to Astra using `mongoose.connect()`, and create a new collection `tests` that has vector search enabled as follows.

```javascript
await mongoose.connect(process.env.ASTRA_URI, { isAstra: true });

// Clean up any existing collection that may conflict
await mongoose.connection.dropCollection('tests');
// Create a new collection with vector search enabled
await mongoose.connection.createCollection('tests', {
  vector: {
    function: 'cosine',
    size: 2
  }
});
```

Create a new [Mongoose model](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) with a `$vector` property.
The `$vector` property is an array of numbers that Astra uses to store the document's vector for vector search.

```javascript
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  $vector: [Number],
  name: String
});
const TestModel = mongoose.model('Test', schema, 'tests');
await TestModel.create({ name: 'Test 1', $vector: [0, 1] });
await TestModel.create({ name: 'Test 2', $vector: [0, -1] });
```

With JSON API, vector search is represented as a [Mongoose query](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html) with a special `sort()` parameter on `$vector`.
The sort parameter to `$vector` tells Astra which vector to find documents closest to.
The following example shows how to query for which documents are closest to the vector `[0.1, -0.9]` followed by the documents closest to `[0.1, 0.9]`:

```javascript
let docs = await TestModel.find()
  .sort({ $vector: { $meta: [0.1, -0.9] } });
// "Test 2", "Test 1"
console.log(docs.map(doc => doc.name));

docs = await TestModel.find()
  .sort({ $vector: { $meta: [0.1, 0.9] } });
// "Test 1", "Test 2"
console.log(docs.map(doc => doc.name));
```
