[Mongoose 8.4.0 was released on May 17, 2024](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/releases/tag/8.4.0) and includes several noteworthy new features.
8.4 is the most significant minor release of the 8.x release series so far.
The biggest new feature is the [`transactionAsyncLocalStorage` option](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/transactions.html#asynclocalstorage), which opts in to using Node.js' [AsyncLocalStorage API](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html) to track transaction sessions automatically.
No need to explicitly pass a `session` option to every operation in a transaction.
There's also an `inferRawDocType` helper for TypeScript that addresses a key design issue in `inferSchemaType`.
In this blog post, I'll cover both how to use `transactionAsyncLocalStorage` and the reasoning behind `inferRawDocType`.

`transactionAsyncLocalStorage`, or, No More `session` Options
-------------------------------

Normally, MongoDB transactions require you to pass a `session` option for every database operation in the transaction to track which transaction this operation is part of.
If you don't set the `session` option, your operation won't be part of your transaction.

```javascript
const Test = mongoose.model('Test', mongoose.Schema({ name: String }));

const doc = await Test.create({ name: 'test' });

// Save a new doc in a transaction that aborts
await connection.transaction(async(session) => {
  doc.name = 'test-updated';

  // You **need** to set `session` here by default. Otherwise
  // `save()` won't execute as part of the transaction.
  await doc.save({ session });
  throw new Error('Oops');
}).catch(() => {});
```

The need to pass `session` is a pain point, because it is easy to forget the `session` option.
In the above example, if you forget the `session` option, the changes to the document's `name` won't get rolled back when the transaction fails.

Using Node's AsyncLocalStorage API, Mongoose's `transaction()` function can set `session` for you automatically.
Here's how you can enable `transactionAsyncLocalStorage` globally:

```javascript
mongoose.set('transactionAsyncLocalStorage', true);
```

Once you enable `transactionAsyncLocalStorage`, Mongoose's `transaction()` function will wrap your transaction executor function in an [`asyncLocalStorage.run()` call](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#asynclocalstoragerunstore-callback-args) with the `session` option.
Then, Mongoose will pull the session from async local storage automatically when you call `save()` or `find()`.
Which means every operation in the `transaction()` executor will automatically be part of the transaction without you having to explicitly pass the `session` option.

```javascript
const doc = await Test.create({ name: 'test' });

// Save a new doc in a transaction that aborts. Even without
// `session`, `doc.save()` executes within the transaction
// because of `transactionAsyncLocalStorage`. 
await connection.transaction(async() => {
  doc.name = 'test-updated';

  await doc.save(); // Notice no session here
  throw new Error('Oops');
}).catch(() => {});
```

AsyncLocalStorage bubbles to any function calls, so your transactions can call helper functions and Mongoose will still automatically attach the session.

```javascript
await connection.transaction(async() => {
  doc.name = 'test-updated';

  // The `save()` call in `saveDoc()` will still automatically
  // get `session` attached even though it is in another function.
  await saveDoc(doc);
  throw new Error('Oops');
}).catch(() => {});

async function saveDoc(doc) {
  await doc.save();
}
```

Currently `transactionAsyncLocalStorage` is only supported as a global option.
There's no way to enable `transactionAsyncLocalStorage` for only some transactions.
However, there is no harm to setting the `session` option if you have `transactionAsyncLocalStorage` enabled.
For example, the following still works as expected even though the `session` option is unnecessary.

```javascript
const doc = await Test.create({ name: 'test' });

await connection.transaction(async(session) => {
  doc.name = 'test-updated';

  // `session` isn't necessary here if `transactionAsyncLocalStorage`
  // is enabled. But specifying `session` won't cause any errors or
  // cause the operation to execute outside the transaction.
  await doc.save({ session });
  throw new Error('Oops');
}).catch(() => {});
```

Getting the Lean Document Type with `inferRawDocType`
------------------------------

Mongoose 8.4 also introduces an `inferRawDocType` helper that returns the raw document type from a schema definition.
The raw document type is the return value from [lean queries](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/lean.html), `.toObject()`, and `.toJSON()`.
It also represents the shape of the object when serialized with [`JSON.stringify()`](https://thecodebarbarian.com/the-80-20-guide-to-json-stringify-in-javascript.html).
So the raw document type has ObjectIds, Dates, and Buffers as objects; but subdocuments are represented as POJOs and Mongoose arrays are represented as vanilla [JavaScript arrays](https://thecodebarbarian.com/the-80-20-guide-to-javascript-arrays.html).

```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const schemaDefinition = {
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  myId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
  },
  subdocs: [new mongoose.Schema({ subdocName: String })]
};
const schema = new mongoose.Schema(schemaDefinition);

/**
 * RawDocType is the following type:
 * {
 *    name: string;
 *    myId?: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
 *    subdocs: {
 *        subdocName?: string;
 *    }[];
 * }
 */
type RawDocType = mongoose.InferRawDocType<typeof schemaDefinition>;
```

How is `InferRawDocType` different from Mongoose's existing `InferSchemaType` helper?
First, `InferSchemaType` takes the `typeof` the schema as an argument, not the schema definition object.
Second, `InferSchemaType` returns the document with document arrays as Mongoose document arrays, rather than vanilla JavaScript arrays of [POJOs](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/pojo).

```ts
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const schemaDefinition = {
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  myId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
  },
  subdocs: [new mongoose.Schema({ subdocName: String })]
};
const schema = new mongoose.Schema(schemaDefinition);

// InferredSchemaType will have `subdocs` as `mongoose.Types.DocumentArray`
type InferredSchemaType = mongoose.InferSchemaType<typeof schema>;
```

In general, `InferSchemaType` is more for Mongoose's internal use for automatic type inference.
The result type from `InferSchemaType` doesn't line up with the raw document type or the hydrated document type.
If you need the raw document type, you should use `InferRawDocType`.

Moving On
---------

`transactionAsyncLocalStorage` and `InferRawDocType` are just two of the 9 new features in Mongoose 8.4.
There's also an officially supported [`omitUndefined()` helper function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/mongoose.html#Mongoose.prototype.omitUndefined()), a [`listDatabases()` function](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/connection.html#Connection.prototype.listDatabases()), schema-level default `readConcern`, and more.
Make sure you upgrade to take advantage of the new features!
