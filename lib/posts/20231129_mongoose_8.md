[Mongoose 8](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/releases/tag/8.0.0) was released on October 31, 2023.
This major release is relatively small compared to [Mongoose 6](/whats-new-in-mongoose-6-sanitizefilter.html), with only [14 backwards breaking changes](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc0).
The driving force for a new major release just 7 months after Mongoose 7 is the [6.0 release of the MongoDB Node.js driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.0.0): we ship a new major version of Mongoose whenever the MongoDB Node.js driver ships a new major version.
We also took the opportunity to remove some deprecated functions from Mongoose 7: most notably, Mongoose 8 no longer supports `count()` or `findOneAndRemove()`.
In this blog post, I'll highlight some other noteworthy changes in Mongoose 8.

[Mongoose's version support policy](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/version-support.html) hasn't changed significantly with Mongoose 8.
We will still continue to ship bug fixes and features to Mongoose 7, as well as Mongoose 8.
Mongoose 5 and Mongoose 6 are still supported, but we will **not** backport any bug fixes or features to Mongoose 5 or 6 unless we are specifically requested to.
Mongoose 5 is scheduled for end-of-life on March 1, 2024; we will **not** ship any fixes to Mongoose 5 after that date.

Without further ado, here's some of the highlights from Mongoose 8.
You can find the full [migration guide](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/migrating_to_8.html) on the Mongoose docs.

Minimize on Update
------------------

[Mongoose's `minimize` option](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#minimize) tells Mongoose to recursively remove empty objects when saving to MongoDB.
For example, suppose you have a `Test` model as follows:

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  nested: {
    field1: Number
  }
});
const Test = mongoose.model('Test', schema);

// Mongoose will remove the `nested` property before storing the new document
const { _id } = await Test.create({ nested: {} });
```

If you load the raw document from MongoDB using `lean()`, you'll see that `nested` is `undefined`, not an empty object.

```javascript
let rawDoc = await Test.findById(_id).lean();
rawDoc.nested; // undefined
```

However, in Mongoose 7, if you set a nested property to an empty object on an existing document, Mongoose won't minimize out that nested property.
For the sake of making the API consistent, we made Mongoose 8 also minimize out empty nested properties when saving an existing document.

```javascript
const doc = await Test.findById(_id);
doc.nested = {};
doc.markModified('nested');
await doc.save();

rawDoc = await Test.findById(_id).lean();
// In Mongoose 7, `rawDoc.nested` will be an empty object `{}`
// In Mongoose 8, `rawDoc.nested` will be `undefined`
rawDoc.nested;
```

If this change is problematic for you, you can either disable `minimize` on your schema:

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  nested: {
    field1: Number
  }
}, {
  minimize: false // Disable minimize for this schema
});
```

Base Schema Validators Run Before Discriminator Schema Validators
-------------------

In Mongoose 7, [discriminator](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/discriminators.html) schemas were added to the base schema; that means base schema keys came _after_ discriminator schema keys in key order, so all validators on base schema keys ran _before_ validators on discriminator schema keys.

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    validate(v) {
      console.log('Base schema validator');
      return true;
    }
  }
});

const Test = mongoose.model('Test', schema);
const D = Test.discriminator('D', new Schema({
  otherProp: {
    type: String,
    get(v) {
      console.log('Discriminator schema validator');
      return true;
    }
  }
}));
```

Mongoose 8 flips the order that `name` and `otherProp` are defined in the `D` model's final merged schema.
In Mongoose 8, `name` will show up before `otherProp` in instances of `D`, and "Base schema validator" will print before "Discriminator schema validator".

```javascript
const doc = new D({ name: 'foo', otherProp: 'bar' });

// Mongoose puts keys in schema order.
// In Mongoose 7, prints `name` after `otherProp`
// In Mongoose 8, prints `otherProp` after `name`
console.log(doc);

// In Mongoose 7, prints "Discriminator schema validator" before "Base schema validator"
// In Mongoose 8, prints "Discriminator schema validator" after "Base schema validator"
await doc.validate();
```

Putting discriminator properties after base schema properties is more intuitive, and helps in cases where discriminator schema setters rely on base schema setters.

String Enums Allow `null`
------------------------

As a general rule of thumb, Mongoose treats `null` and `undefined` (so-called [nullish values](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/falsy#nullish-values)) as interchangeable.
Before Mongoose 8, there was one big exception to this rule: `null` wasn't allowed as a value for string paths with an [`enum`](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/enum), even if the path wasn't `required`.

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['active', 'disabled']
  }
});

const Test = mongoose.model('Test', schema);

const doc = new Test({ status: null });
// In Mongoose 8, the following `validate()` call succeeds
// In Mongoose 7, the following `validate()` throws a validation error
await doc.validate();
```

This behavior was inconsistent for a couple of reasons.
First, while `null` wasn't allowed, `undefined` was.

```javascript
const doc = new Test({ status: undefined });
// Succeeds in both Mongoose 7 and Mongoose 8
await doc.validate();
```

Second, number enums allowed `null`, string enums didn't.

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  myNum: {
    type: Number,
    enum: [1, 2, 3]
  }
});

const Test = mongoose.model('Test', schema);

const doc = new Test({ myNum: null });
// Succeeds in both Mongoose 7 and Mongoose 8
await doc.validate();
```

In Mongoose 8, `null` is valid for string enums, unless the path is also [required](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/schematype.html#SchemaType.prototype.required()).

```javascript
const schema = new Schema({
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['active', 'disabled'],
    required: true // Disallow `null` and `undefined`
  }
});

const Test = mongoose.model('Test', schema);

const doc = new Test({ status: null });
// Throws a ValidationError in both Mongoose 7 and Mongoose 8
await doc.validate();
```

Moving On
---------

Mongoose 8 is a relatively small release, but we think the changes make Mongoose's API more consistent and streamlined.
Check out the [migration guide](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/migrating_to_8.html) for a full list of all the potentially breaking changes.
Please upgrade and open any issues you find on [Mongoose's GitHub page](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/new)!
